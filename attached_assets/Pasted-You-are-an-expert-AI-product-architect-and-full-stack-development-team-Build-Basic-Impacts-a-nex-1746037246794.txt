You are an expert AI product architect and full-stack development team. Build “Basic Impacts,” a next-generation, Canada-first impact accountability and benchmarking platform for the non-profit, corporate, and government sectors. This platform must set a new global standard for transparency, usability, and data-driven social impact measurement.

1. Platform Overview
Purpose:
Enable the public, funders, and organizations to discover, compare, and validate the real-world impact of Canadian organizations and their programs, combatting greenwashing and impact washing.

Core Modules:

Impact Exchange (Front-End): Public dashboards, leaderboards, solution finder, and organization/program profiles.

Impact Engine (Back-End): Automated document ingestion, NLP-powered report parsing, metric extraction, scoring engine, and analytics API.

2. Front-End: Impact Exchange
Public Leaderboard:

Real-time, sortable tables of top organizations and programs by sector, region, SDG alignment, and trending status.

“Impact IQ” composite scores, grading badges (A–F), and verification icons (self-reported, document-verified, third-party audited).

Stock-market style tickers for fast risers and trending declines.

Organization & Program Profiles:

Logo, mission, funding received, impact score, reporting grade.

Drill-down analytics: sub-scores (Reporting Quality, Reach, Social ROI, Outcome Effectiveness, Transparency & Governance).

Timeline of impact and reporting history.

Solution Finder:

Search by need/problem (e.g., “food security,” “mental health”).

Filter by demographic, region, SDG, or solution type.

Peer reviews, testimonials, and public voting for “Community Choice” awards.

“Share Your Solution” feature for organizations to post needs and offerings.

Self-Service Portal:

For organizations to claim profiles, upload reports, update data, and respond to public feedback.

Verified badge system (e.g., “Transparency Champion,” “Third-Party Audited”).

Design & Accessibility:

Clean, data-driven UI (React/Next.js + Tailwind CSS), mobile-first, bilingual (EN/FR), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

Interactive charts (D3.js or Recharts), heatmaps, and time-series graphs.

3. Back-End: Impact Engine
Document Ingestion & NLP Analysis:

Bulk and manual upload of annual, financial, and impact reports (PDF, Word, Excel).

Automated parsing using spaCy, AWS Textract, or similar for extracting numeric and narrative metrics, SDG tags, and outcome statements.

AI validation to flag discrepancies (e.g., claimed vs. verified beneficiaries, missing data).

Data Management & Scheduling:

Relational DB (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB) for storing organizations, programs, reports, metrics, and metadata.

Metadata repository: sector, region, report date, funding sources, SDG alignment.

Automated monthly re-indexing and analytics refresh (Celery or similar scheduler).

Analytics & Visualization API:

RESTful endpoints for all front-end queries (leaderboards, profiles, solution finder, trends).

Graphing service for time-series and comparative charts.

Admin tools for flagging, review, and approval of organization submissions.

4. Metrics & Scoring Model
Core Quantitative Metrics:

People Reached (unique beneficiaries)

Social ROI (CAD value created per $1 invested)

Cost Savings (aggregate $ saved in health, education, food, housing)

Cost per Impact (e.g., $ per child educated)

Program Scalability (% growth YoY)

Replication Rate (regions/countries adopted)

Funding Allocation (% to programs vs. overhead)

Outcome & Effectiveness Metrics:

Outcome Improvement (% change in key indicators: literacy, employment, health)

Sustainability Alignment (mapping to UN SDGs)

Longitudinal Outcomes (% beneficiaries sustained out of poverty after 5 years)

Accountability & Transparency Metrics:

Transparency Score (frequency/quality of public reports, third-party audits)

Report Completeness (% required fields populated)

Timeliness (days from fiscal year end to report upload)

Data Quality Score (anomaly/missing value detection)

Qualitative Metrics:

Beneficiary testimonials (structured surveys, interviews)

Partner/community ratings (trust, cultural sensitivity)

Innovation & Collaboration (unique solutions, partnerships)

Composite “Impact IQ” Score:

Weighted aggregation of sub-scores:

Reporting Quality (20%)

Reach (20%)

Social ROI (20%)

Outcome Effectiveness (20%)

Transparency & Governance (20%)

Allow drill-down into each sub-score and display historical trends.

5. Additional Features & Recommendations
Gamification:

Badges for organizations (e.g., “Transparency Champion”)

Public voting for “Community Choice” awards

Compliance & Security:

Secure authentication (OAuth 2.0), role-based access, PIPEDA-compliant data handling

API compatibility with third-party auditors (e.g., Charity Intelligence Canada)

Collaboration Hub:

“Match with Innovators” button for NGOs/corporates to co-develop solutions.

Monetization:

Premium profiles, featured listings, grants for top solutions, municipal/corporate subscriptions.

6. Technical Stack
Front-End:

TypeScript, React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts/D3.js

Back-End:

Python, Flask or FastAPI, Celery, spaCy, AWS Textract

Database:

PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB for time-series data

Deployment:

Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Accessibility & Localization:

WCAG 2.1 AA, bilingual (EN/FR)
